Topic: ATAC-Seq data analysis.

With the help of nucleosomes, the genome is organized and tightly packed in many eukaryotic organisms, including humans (chromatin). Numerous factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position of the nucleosomes, and histone modifications, have a significant impact on the organization and accessibility of the DNA. As a result, these components affect how genes are activated and deactivated. The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) technique investigates the accessibility of chromatin to determine the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. I aimed to contrast the projected open chromatin regions with the recognized CTCF binding sites, a DNA-binding protein thought to be involved in 3D structure. In order to complete this project, I employed the following techniques: peak calling, preprocessing, mapping, filtering mapped reads, filtering duplicate reads, and visualization of coverage. I identified open chromatin regions using MACS2, a method for identifying genomic enrichment regions (peaks). I investigated the read coverage close to the TSS using computeMatrix and plotHeatmap. Putative enhancer regions in open chromatin regions that did not coincide with CTCF sites or TSS may have been discovered by the ATAC-Seq experiment.
